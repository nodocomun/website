      <p>Through research, analysis and visualization of data on the development of emerging political practices, Update aims to generate insights and share ideas that contribute to strengthen the ecosystem, as well as stimulate new experiments.</p>

      <p>To fulfill this goal Update presents this permanent mapping of initiatives that make up this field, identifying actors (hubs) that integrate it and creating a dynamic display to give visibility to their actions (signals). To make visualization of mapped initiatives easier we created this interactive platform to help navigate through terminologies and filters more easily.</p>

      <p>We initiated the mapping in June 2015, and had registered 700 initiatives by November of the same year. In January 2016 more than 150 initiatives ceased existing, which shows the highly volatile dynamics of this field. At the same time, each week we identify newly created initiatives, which add up to this vision of ecosystem. The mapping visualization platform was released in April 2016 and is being updated daily by Update’s team.</p>"

    "title": "Methodology",
    "text": "<p>Starting from the hypothesis that a new ecosystem of political participation was emerging in Latin America, we carried out a ten month exploratory research that mapped traces and evidences that contribute to the creation of a more permeable State and more active citizenship, in which distances between civil society and public power are reduced.</p>


    <p>Considering the complexity of this context, the absence of specific bibliography, the lack of knowledge on this field’s magnitude and the relevance of determining a permanent and laboratorial process, we decided to start a secondary data research, which collected a series of available information, mainly in the internet, by organizations, groups, initiatives and individuals who are experimenting new ways of participation and incidence in the political field.</p>

    <p>Initial criteria for the mapping were:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class=\"list\">Geography: initiatives that were originated or that act directly upon Latin America.</li>
      <li class=\"list\">Thematic: initiatives that work in themes related with reducing the distance between civil society and public power – citizen participation; transparency and accountability; social control; political culture; independent media; and government 2.0. These themes are in the Signals section of the platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The database also integrates information collected by partners, such as Sonho Brasileiro da Política (Brazilian Dream of Politics), Civic Stack and Manifesto do Ecossistema Brasileiro da Participação Social (Brazilian Social Participation Ecosystem Manifesto), from which it was possible to identify varying degrees of affinity with the purpose of this mapping.</p>

    <p>From this free exploration of data, the need to create criteria was verified, such as the balance between the countries [Brazil represents one third of the database due to its geographic dimension and 21 independent countries under democratic regimes were contemplated] and standardization of taxonomy, in such a way that a precise and consistent field observation was guaranteed. As a complementary strategy, discussion groups with specialists were carried out.</p>

    <p>The traces and evidences identified along the exploration process were called signals and are the most relevant indicators for this mapping. These signals are emitted by multiple actors, the hubs, which were also categorized to make understanding and hypothesis building easier.</p>

    <p>This unprecedented and experimental platform reveals 700 hubs and signals categorized using criteria such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li class=\"list\">Hubs: nature, country, reach [local, regional and international] and if it is an ecosystem financer.</li>

      <li class=\"list\">Signals: country, reach [local, regional and international], type of technology [social or digital], impact proposition [empowerment or incidence], related themes and type of mechanism used [methods].
    </li></ul>


    <p>The objective, therefore, is to provide a broad view of this ecosystem, identifying actors and practices and making database visualization easy. As outcomes, Update foresees new studies to deepen formulated hypothesis in this phase.</p>

    <p>This mapping is a sample, of exploratory character, of Latin American initiatives. It wouldn’t be possible to map all the initiatives because of the highly dynamic nature of this field, or in other words, because of the speed with which they emerge, are transformed or discontinued. There is also a strong influence of social, economic and political contexts of each country on the initiatives that emerge in these places, so that understanding the mapped initiatives can become profoundly complex.</p>

    <p>The information presented in the description of initiatives is original from the source, extracted from sites, social media and institutional presentations.</p>

<p class=\"text\">To reach a definition of the mechanism, methods were grouped by affinity from their common characteristics. As a cut, it was determined that each signal would have at least one mechanism and at most three.
